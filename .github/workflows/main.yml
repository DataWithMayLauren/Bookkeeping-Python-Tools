def calculate_expenses():
    print("--- May Lauren's Expense Tracker ---")
    
    # 1. Asking for numbers
    # We use float() so the user can enter decimals like 100.50
    income = float(input("Enter total monthly income: "))
    expenses = float(input("Enter total monthly expenses: "))
    
    # 2. The Logic
    profit = income - expenses
    
    # Preventing a crash if income is 0
    if income > 0:
        savings_rate = (profit / income) * 100
    else:
        savings_rate = 0
    
    # 3. Showing the results
    print(f"\n--- Financial Summary ---")
    print(f"Total Income:  ${income:,.2f}")
    print(f"Total Expense: ${expenses:,.2f}")
    print(f"Net Profit:    ${profit:,.2f}")
    print(f"Savings Rate:  {savings_rate:.2f}%")
